.TH QSIPHON 1
.SH NAME
qsiphon - a utility for extracting qf/df files from an active mqueue directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qsiphon [-MUhd] [-K seconds] <{ -L "host [, ...]" | -R "regex" }> indir/ <{ outdir/ | /dev/null }>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqsiphon\fR is a utility that helps manage large volumes of mqueue (qf and df)
files. This utility is useful when you have a large corpus of message queue files
and would like to extract a portion of them out of the sendmail processing queue
(\fB/var/spool/mqueue\fR) reliably without interfering with other processes
working within the same directory.  \fBqsiphon\fR accomplishes this by issuing a
call to \fBflock(2)\fR.

\fBqsiphon\fR examines the contents of each qf file, and based on whether it matched a
regular expression (given with the \fB-R\fR or \fB-L\fR options), or whether it should
be kept based on its age (specified with \fB-K\fR) it either moves the qf (and associated
df) files to the output directory, or it moves things that \fBDO NOT MATCH\fR into the output
directory.  If the \fBoutdir\fR directory is \fB/dev/null\fR, or a dev null character device,
then the action performed is a delete operation rather than moving the file(s).

Please note that regular expression library in use by \fBqsiphon\fR is \fBpcre(3)\fR,
the \fBPerl Compatible Regular Expressions\fR engine. See the man page for \fBpcre(3)\fR
for more information on writing PCRE regular expressions.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
\fB-L \fI"host1 [, host2 ...]"\fR
The \fB-L\fR switch is used when you want to match a list of hosts against SMTP
\fBReceived\fR header fields.  The list of hosts should be contained within quotes and
seperated with commas or spaces.  Using \fB-L\fR automatically generates an internal
regular expression that is used to match against qf files' \fBReceived\fR entries.

Note that the use of one of the \fB-L\fR or \fB-R\fR switches are mandatory and mutually
exclusive (you must use one, but not both).
.TP
\fB-R \fI"expression"\fR
The \fB-R\fR option does not match against any particular header field like \fB-L\fR does,
rather it just performs straight regular expression matches against any portion of the qf
file.

Be aware that typical RE special characters (like \\s, \\w, etc), or any backslash
quoted character for that matter should be written with \fBtwo\fR backslashes.  This is because
the C programming language also makes use of the backslash for quoting special characters.
So, for instance, to pass a backslash literal you must use two backslashes (e.g., to match one
or more \fBspace\fR characters you would write \\\\s+).
.TP
\fB-K \fIseconds\fR
Sometimes you may wish to keep or remove queue files that are a particular age.  This option
allows the preservation or removal of qf/df file pairs newer (or older) than a specific
number of seconds (depending on whether the \fB-M\fR option is used which inverts the default
behavior).  This option has the effect of causing a match in the same sense that the \fB-L\fR,
or \fB-R\fR switches cause a match.
.TP
\fB-M\fR
The use of \fB-M\fR inverts the action associated with the matching logic.  Normally the
default behavior is to move any qf/df pair that \fBDO NOT\fR match into the output directory.
However, if you only wish to move qf/df files that MATCH then this option should be used.
This is ideal for extracting vital messages from an active message queue.
.TP
\fB-U\fR
Forces the deletion of qf files that do not have a matching df file pair.  The default behavior
is to preserve them.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print a short form of the command usage.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Print some debugging output when running.
.TP
\fBinput-directory\fR
The input directory must exist and be readable and writable.
.TP
\fBoutput-directory\fR
The output directory need not exist -- it will be automatically created if it's
missing. Therefore its parent directory must be writable by \fBqsiphon\fR. If 
the output directory is created it will be given the same user and group ownerships
and file modes as the input directory.  If the output directory is \fB/dev/null\fR
then the action performed on the files will be an unlink operation rathern than
moving them.

.SH EXAMPLES

.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.I qsiphon -L 'mx-submission, mx-feedback' -K 3600 -U /var/spool/mqueue /var/spool/removed

Move all qf/df files to \fB/var/spool/removed\fR that do not contain "mx-submission", or "mx-feedback"
in the mail headers' Received lines, or any file older than one hour.

Delete any qf files that do not have matching df files.

.TP
.I qsiphon -L 'mx-submission, mx-feedback' -K 3600 -M /var/spool/mqueue /var/spool/saved

Move all qf/df files to \fB/var/spool/saved\fR that match "mx-submission", or "mx-feedback"
in the mail header Received entries, or any file newer than an hour.

.TP
.I qsiphon -R '^RPFD:.*me@upt\\\\.org' -M /var/spool/mqueue /var/spool/my-mails

Move messages matching the regular expression given to the specified output directory
(Note that the quoting meta-character (\\) was only used once because it appears in
single quotes rather than double quotations).

.TP
.I qsiphon -U -M -R '^H\\\\?\\\\?Subject: Invoice# \\\\d+$' /var/spool/mqueue /dev/null

Delete messages containing a particular string in the Subject header line.
